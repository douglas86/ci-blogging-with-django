When deploying to Heroku, but you haven't done any css styling yet?
Add the variable DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC
with the value of 1
this will then allow you to run the project without static files

Once you have static files up and running do the following?
Install whitenoise: $ pip install whitenoise
add package to requirements: $ pip freeze --local > requirements.txt
add package to middleware in settings file under the middleware that says, 'SecurityMiddleware'
add this to middleware section: 'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
under the STATIC_URL variable add the following variable
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_URL, 'staticfiles')
run the collectstatic command to collect all static files: $ python manage.py collectstatic
which creates a staticfiles directory with all static files in project

If you are wanting to propulate your db with additional content?
Create a fixtures directory under blog app,

$ python manage.py loaddata posts
Django knows to look in the blog app to run the posts file
